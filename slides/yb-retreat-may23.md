Concrete: The properties and performance of concrete can be tailored to meet design requirements by varying the type and quantity of the mixture constituents (e.g., cement, water, aggregate, and admixtures). Traditional approaches for designing concrete mixtures often rely on trial-and-error, iterative proportioning, processing, and characterization until the target properties are achieved.

Concrete: it is possible to optimize the compressive strength of concrete mixtures by adjusting the water/cement ratio, total aggregate/cement ratio, and coarse aggregate/total aggregate ratio6. Yet the practical application of this iterative refinement approach is limited by the exponential increase in the number of specimens and experiments when complex concrete mixtures are studied and several compositional parameters are simultaneously considered as combinatorial variables. As a result, materials development in concrete science involves time-consuming validation/development cycles from laboratory trials to field applications. Efforts to accelerate knowledge acquisition and materials design in concrete science are thus of paramount importance.

Beginning in the 1980s, the development of microstructural models of cement hydration has enabled a fundamental understanding of microstructure–property relationships in concrete7, which has marked the second paradigm. By applying basic laws of kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanics, and providing analytical solutions to cement hydration. Successful demonstrations include the three-dimensional cement hydration and microstructure development model (CEMHYD3D)8,9; the hydration, morphology, and structural development model (HYMOSTRUC)10; the integrated particle kinetics model11; and the microstructural modeling platform (μic)

Concrete: However, the complex nature of cement hydration makes it challenging to develop accurate and generalizable models, and these modeling approaches, to varying degrees, rely on thermochemical, physical, and structural data that must be obtained either from accurate experimental observations or from calculations at the atomistic and molecular scales.

In this context, the use of density-functional theory (DFT) and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been explored in concrete science since the 2000s owing to the ever-growing computing power16. This has given rise to the third paradigm (computational science; Fig. 1), where the first-principle models have been integrated and employed to further describe cementitious materials properties and improve understanding of cement hydration. Related simulation efforts have focused primarily on cementitious phases such as the calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel, the essential reaction product of cement hydration.

Concrete: However, these computational techniques require considerable computational resources and thus come with significant challenges, such as their limited time scales and the relatively small number of atoms in a simulated system. In addition, it may be difficult to validate these simulations with experiments, given the small time and length scales and high-fidelity measurements required.

By leveraging existing datasets with data-driven models, ML can automatically learn implicit patterns and extract valuable information while accounting for the inherent complexity of concrete mixtures and their properties.
