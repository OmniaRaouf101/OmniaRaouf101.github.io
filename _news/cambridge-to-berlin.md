title: Bye Cambridge! Hallo Berlin!
layout: page
---
My internship at the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit of the University of Cambridge is over and I am back in Berlin!

It's been almost three months living in Cambridge and working at the [CBU](http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/) with [Dr. Tim Kietzmann](http://www.timkietzmann.de/) and the time has passed so quickly. Hopefully soon we will start writing a manuscript about the worked I did in Cambridge, which I will continue now from Berlin. 

The project was not too different from what I have been doing in Berlin, as it's a follow up of my main research on [data augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03852), but living in Cambridge was indeed quite different than living in Berlin! One is a small British city, the other is a big European capital; one has a scatter of Gothic colleges, the other has an eclectic mix of buildings; one has a fantastic offer of cask ales in its many pubs, the other has a wonderful offer of Sp√§tis in its streets. This could follow endlessly. Just as a metaphor of the difference, see the contrast of the photos I took on my last day in Cambridge and what I first encountered when I walked home from Ostbahnhof in Berlin.

But don't take me wrong: I love Berlin!
