This week I am attending the [VSS 2019](https://www.visionsciences.org/general-information/) meeting and presenting a [poster]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/vss19-poster.pdf), "Saliency and the population receptive field model to identify images from brain activity", the project I carried out during my internship at the Spinoza Centre for Neuroimaging in Amsterdam.

It is the first time I attend the annual meeting of the Vision Sciences Society (VSS) in St. Pete Beach, Florida (USA) and it is very exciting to participate in such a big event of the vision research community. Hard to keep track of the myriad of interesting talks and posters! 

As always, it is also a great pleasure to see friends and colleagues from past conferences and meetings in the field.
