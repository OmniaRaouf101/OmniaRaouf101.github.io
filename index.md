#### Brief academic bio
I am a physics graduate with a strong interest in quantum computing, machine learning, and their applications in various fields. I'm passionate about making quantum computing more accessible through research, education, and collaboration. 

Currently, I am a research intern at the **National Authority for Remote Sensing & Space Sciences (NARSS)**, where I explore space weather problems using machine learning and quantum computing. Additionally, I am interning at **Trevasq** as a Quantum Algorithms Intern, focusing on quantum computing applications in finance. I have recently completed my bachelor's degree and am eagerly awaiting my next academic adventure, hoping to start my quantum master's program this cohort.
